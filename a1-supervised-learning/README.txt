The code for this assignment can be found at this GitHub URL:
https://github.com/changrybirds/ml-2019fall/tree/master/a1-supervised-learning

This assignment folder contains all the code necessary to run the experiments.

The top folder in this repository contains a requirements.txt file that lists the exact
packages needed to run the code.

The main packages necessary to run the code in this repo are:
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - sklearn
    - matplotlib

Each learning algorithm has its own script - running the script in a terminal
or a python interpreter will run the corresponding experiment for that learning algorithm
on both datasets, and will generate the necessary charts.

All charts are generated and saved in the `graphs/` subdirectory.
